"This is a good time for trekking in the Hill Country or climbing Sigiriya, as the weather is mostly dry but not as " +
"hot as in the height of summer. From August to September, hundreds of elephants group together for several weeks " +
"in Minneriya National Park during the annual Gathering. It's one of Asia’s great wildlife spectacles, and you have " +
"a good chance of seeing baby elephants.\n\n" +
"October can be a bit unpredictable, with the summertime Yala monsoon fading and conditions building towards the Maha " +
"monsoon. Thunderstorms can arrive in the afternoons, and rain is common, but there's still good surfing on the east " +
"coast. Just add a raincoat to your list of things to pack.\n\n" +
"After the busy winter season, April is warm and dry across the majority of the country, and prices fall as the peak " +
"season crowds depart. Although Christians comprise only six percent of Sri Lanka’s population, Christian festivals " +
"– including Easter, which usually falls in April – are still celebrated with gusto.\n\n" +
"A more significant event in April is Avurudu, the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year. New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day are " +
"official holidays, and over the days before and after, buses and trains are jammed as people flee from big cities to " +
"home villages.";

"beach resorts such as Hikkaduwa and Mirissa are at their most idyllic, but also busiest, aligning with excellent surfing"+
"conditions on the south and west coasts. However, the Maha monsoon season (October to January) keeps the East, the North,"+
"and the Ancient Cities humid and rainy at this time of year.\n\n"+
"Sri Lanka is a year-round wildlife-watching destination, but the best times to spot elephants, leopards and buffalo is "+
"during the main November-to-April tourist season. All the big parks are open and animals start to gather around water holes, "+
"making them easier to spot. However, the island's greatest wildlife spectacle – the Gathering of elephants at Minneriya "+
"National Park – takes place from July to September.\n\n "+
"By December, high season is in full swing, with bathers jostling for towel space on the beaches along the south and west coasts. "+
"The pilgrimage season on Adam’s Peak, when pilgrims of all faiths climb the sacred summit, starts in December and lasts until mid-April.\n\n";

export const p3 = "The low season in Sri Lanka starts with the arrival of the Yala monsoon in May, which pounds the west and south "+

"for its consistent point breaks and laid-back surf scene.\n\n"+
"If anywhere deserves to be called a year-round destination, it’s Sri Lanka. This small island boasts a diverse collection of microclimates – "+
"when it's raining on one stretch of coast, the weather is perfect for surfing or sightseeing on another.\n\n"+
"On most trips, people mix up beach time with detours to national parks, and trips to the cooler highlands and ancient cities in the middle "+

export const p4 = "The period from April to September is one of the best times to explore Sri Lanka’s Hill Country and Cultural Triangle. "+
"As the southwest monsoon (known locally as the Yala monsoon) fades, the central highlands, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, and Ella, remain "+
"relatively dry, making it ideal for trekking through tea plantations, hiking to World’s End at Horton Plains National Park, or climbing "+
"the famous Sigiriya Rock Fortress. Temperatures in these higher-altitude areas are cooler, making for pleasant outdoor adventures, whether "+
"you’re trekking to waterfalls or visiting ancient temples.\n\n"+
"Another highlight during this period is the annual Gathering of Elephants at Minneriya National Park, which occurs from August to September. "+
"This incredible wildlife event, one of the largest elephant gatherings in Asia, sees hundreds of elephants congregating at the park’s "+
"reservoir. It’s a unique opportunity to observe these majestic creatures in their natural habitat, including the sight of baby elephants "+
"frolicking by the water.";

export const p5 = "Wildlife enthusiasts can head to Yala National Park and Udawalawe National Park for safari experiences. Yala is particularly "+
"famous for its leopards, while Udawalawe is known for its large elephant population. With less rain and abundant waterholes, this time of year "+
"offers better opportunities for wildlife sightings.";

export const p6 = "April and September to October are often considered the shoulder seasons, where Sri Lanka transitions between the two monsoons. "+
"These months offer an excellent balance of favorable weather and fewer crowds. April is particularly special because it coincides with Avurudu, "+
"the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year, a vibrant cultural festival where you can witness traditional customs and celebrations. \n\n"+
"For hikers and adventure seekers, these shoulder seasons are ideal for trekking in the Knuckles Mountain Range, climbing Adam’s Peak (Sri Pada), "+

"is a world-famous surf destination, drawing surfers from around the globe to its waves.\n\n"+
"If surfing isn’t your thing, you can still enjoy the crystal-clear waters of Nilaveli Beach and visit Pigeon Island National Park for excellent"+
"snorkeling and diving opportunities, where you can swim among vibrant coral reefs and marine life. The east coast’s serene beauty and laid-back "+
"atmosphere offer a peaceful escape from the busier tourist spots on the west.";

export const p8 = "While October and November can be unpredictable due to the Maha monsoon, this time of year also has its own unique charm. "+
"The rains bring out Sri Lanka’s lush greenery, and the waterfalls across the island, particularly in the central highlands, are at their most "+

export const p9 = "This is the best time for trips to Jaffna in the North and the chilled-out resorts along the East Coast, such as Arugam Bay, known "+

"Despite the rain, many must-see festivals take place during this period, including Vesak Poya, a two-day festival in May when colored lights "+
"adorn every Buddhist home, shop, and temple. There's also the vibrant Esala Perahera in Kandy, where thousands of dancers and drummers form a "+
"giant procession through the town.\n\n"+
"The rains dampen tourism in June, except on the East Coast beaches, which stay drier at this time. Meanwhile, another major Buddhist event, "+
"the Poson Poya, gets underway, celebrating the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka. Major festivities take place in the temples of Anuradhapura, "+
"and thousands of white-clad pilgrims ascend the 1843 calf-busting steps to Mihintale’s sacred stupa.\n\n" +
"For travelers who aren’t easily disheartened by the odd downpour, summer is a good time to be in Sri Lanka. The focal point for the country’s "+
"Buddhists is Esala Perahera in July or August, which lasts for 10 days. The Kandy Esala Perahera is legendary, but smaller parades are held "+
"across Sri Lanka. Many celebrations feature dancers, drummers, and stilt walkers who practice all year for the occasion.\n\n"+
"Another large-scale procession takes place in Colombo as part of the Hindu festival of Aadi Vel, which sees the gilded chariot of Murugan "+
"(Skanda), the Hindu god of war, ceremonially hauled through the city’s streets. To maximize the chance of avoiding the rain, head north to "+
"Jaffna, where the famous Nallur Kandaswamy Kovil hosts the spectacular Nallur Festival (sometimes starting in July). The event climaxes "+
"with parades of juggernaut floats and gruesome displays of self-mortification by entranced devotees.";

export const p10="Sri Lanka is a year-round destination, but the best times to visit depend on which part of the country you "
