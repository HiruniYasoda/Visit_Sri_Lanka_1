+"experiences. Start your journey by exploring Sigiriya, the iconic rock fortress. This UNESCO World Heritage Site features "
+"stunning frescoes, landscaped gardens, and a climb up to the Lion's Rock, offering panoramic views of the surrounding jungle. "
+"Nearby, the ancient city of Polonnaruwa provides insight into Sri Lanka's rich history, with well-preserved ruins and temples "
+"For nature lovers, a visit to Yala National Park is a must. Yala is one of the best places in Asia to spot leopards in the "
+"wild, alongside elephants, sloth bears, and a diverse bird population. Another natural wonder is the Horton Plains National "
+"Park, where visitors can hike to World’s End, a dramatic cliff with a breathtaking view. The country's diverse landscapes "
+"also allow for thrilling activities such as surfing in Arugam Bay, scuba diving near Pigeon Island, and trekking through "
+"the Knuckles Mountain Range.\n\n" +
"The beaches of Sri Lanka are world-famous, with options for relaxation and adventure. Unawatuna and Mirissa attract "
+"visitors with their beautiful sands and vibrant nightlife, while the beaches of Trincomalee are quieter, offering "
+"crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and whale watching. The cultural capital of Kandy should not be missed, "
+"particularly for its Temple of the Tooth, a revered Buddhist pilgrimage site. Finally, Sri Lanka’s culinary scene, "
+"characterized by dishes like hoppers, kottu, and crab curry, provides a delicious introduction to its culture. Exploring "
+"local markets and street food stalls will enrich any trip.\n\n";


export const p2 = "Visitors planning a trip to Sri Lanka should be aware of the visa requirements. Fortunately, obtaining a "
+"Sri Lankan visa is relatively simple. Tourists can apply for an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) before arrival, "
+"which allows for a stay of up to 30 days. The ETA is accessible for citizens of most countries and can be applied for "
+"online, with approvals typically granted within a few days. Travelers will need to provide details such as passport "
+"information, travel dates, and accommodation plans.\n\n"+
"It is advisable to apply for the ETA at least a week before your trip to avoid any last-minute issues. The ETA can also be "
+"extended for an additional 60 days by applying at the Department of Immigration and Emigration in Colombo, allowing travelers "
+"to enjoy the country for up to three months. Upon arrival, make sure your passport is valid for at least six months from the "
+"date of entry, as this is a standard requirement. For longer stays or other types of visas, such as business visas or work "
+"permits, it’s necessary to apply through Sri Lanka's embassies or consulates abroad.\n\n "+
"Certain nationalities, including citizens of Singapore and the Maldives, are exempt from visa fees and can enter Sri Lanka "
+"visa-free. For other travelers, there is a nominal fee associated with the ETA. Those arriving without an ETA can still "
+"obtain one on arrival, though this may involve longer wait times at the airport. It's also essential to have proof of "
+"onward travel and sufficient funds to cover your stay in Sri Lanka. For visitors planning multiple entries, a multiple-entry "
+"visa is available, which is beneficial for those looking to visit nearby countries during their trip.\n\n";

export const p3 = "Understanding the cost of travel in Sri Lanka and how to manage your expenses is key to an enjoyable trip. "

+"vendors accept credit cards. Currency exchange services are widely available at airports, banks, and authorized money "
+"changers in major towns. It’s recommended to exchange a small amount at the airport upon arrival for convenience.\n\n"+
"ATMs are common in urban areas, and most machines accept international debit and credit cards. However, in rural areas, cash "
+"is preferred, and it may be challenging to find ATMs. Daily costs in Sri Lanka are affordable, with budget travelers "
+"needing around USD 25-50 per day, while mid-range travelers should budget USD 50-100 per day. This covers accommodation, "
+"meals, and transportation.\n\n"+
"Transportation costs are generally low. Public buses and trains offer the cheapest means of travel, while tuk-tuks provide "
+"a more flexible way to navigate towns and cities. Hiring a private car with a driver is popular for comfort and convenience, "
+"especially for longer trips or traveling with luggage. Food is also inexpensive, with local meals costing around USD 2-5. "
+"Western-style restaurants and higher-end dining may cost more, averaging USD 10-20 per meal.\n\n"+
"For accommodation, budget options like guesthouses start at around USD 10-20 per night, while mid-range hotels charge around "
+"USD 30-60. Luxury hotels and resorts cost upwards of USD 100 per night. To save on expenses, book accommodations in advance, "
+"avoid peak tourist seasons, and consider staying in less touristy areas. Visitors should also factor in the cost of entrance "
+"fees for attractions, such as USD 30 for Sigiriya Rock and USD 20 for national parks." ;
