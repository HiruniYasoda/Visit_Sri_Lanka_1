export const p3 = "In ancient Sri Lanka, the languages of Sanskrit and Pali played a vital role in religious and scholarly "
+"texts. Sanskrit, a classical language of ancient India, was used in Hindu rituals and literature, while Pali became the "
+"language of Theravada Buddhism. The Pali Canon, known as the Tripitaka, was written in this language, and it "
+"remains a cornerstone of Buddhist studies. Sanskrit, though less commonly spoken, influenced many aspects of the Sinhala "

export const p4 = "In Sri Lanka, the traditional greeting is 'Ayubowan' which means 'May you live long'. "
+"Accompanied by a slight bow and hands clasped together in a gesture of respect, this greeting is a mark "
+"of Sri Lankan hospitality and culture. The smile that often accompanies this greeting reflects the warmth and "
+"friendliness of the Sri Lankan people. While 'Ayubowan' is most common among the Sinhala-speaking population, "
+"it transcends ethnic boundaries and is used in everyday interactions, formal settings, and by those in the "
+"service industry, making it a symbol of respect, good wishes, and the island's cultural identity.";

export const p5 = "Buddhism has played a profound role in shaping Sri Lanka’s cultural, spiritual, and political history. "
+"Introduced in the 3rd century BCE by Mahinda Thera, the son of Emperor Ashoka of India, Buddhism became the island’s dominant "

+"and social structure. Key Buddhist landmarks, such as the sacred city of Anuradhapura and the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, "
+"stand as testaments to its historical importance. Over the centuries, Buddhist values have shaped governance and daily life, "
+"ensuring that Buddhism remains central to the spiritual life of Sri Lankans.";

export const p6 = "Catholicism in Sri Lanka has roots dating back to the arrival of Portuguese colonizers in the early 16th century. "
+"With the spread of Portuguese influence came the introduction of Roman Catholicism, which was actively promoted through missionary "
+"work. St. Francis Xavier is credited with some of the early efforts to convert the local population. Catholicism faced challenges "
+"during the Dutch and British colonial periods, as these powers promoted Protestantism. However, Catholicism remained resilient, "
+"particularly in coastal regions. Today, Sri Lankan Catholics represent a significant minority, with the religion having influenced "
+"various aspects of education, social work, and religious festivals in the country.";

export const p7 = "Hinduism in Sri Lanka is closely linked to the island's Tamil population, primarily in the northern and eastern "
+"regions. It is one of the oldest religions on the island, with a history stretching back to the ancient Tamil kingdoms. Hindu "
+"temples, known for their intricate Dravidian architecture, dot the landscape in these areas. The religion’s influence is evident "
+"in cultural practices, festivals like Deepavali, and rituals that are integral to daily life. The arrival of Hinduism likely "
+"predates recorded history, and it has coexisted with Buddhism for centuries, contributing to the island's rich spiritual tapestry.";

export const p8 = "Islam was introduced to Sri Lanka by Arab traders as early as the 7th century. These traders established strong "
+"commercial ties with the island, and over time, some settled and intermarried with local communities, giving rise to the Sri Lankan "
+"Muslim community, known as the Moors. The religion expanded further under subsequent colonial regimes, though it remained a "
+"minority faith. Sri Lankan Muslims have traditionally engaged in trade and commerce and have built a strong cultural and religious "
+"identity. Islam has contributed to the country’s rich mosaic of traditions, with mosques and Islamic schools being integral to the "
+"community.";

export const p9 = "Sri Lanka’s traditional dance forms are deeply tied to its cultural identity, with three main styles emerging from "
+"different regions. Udarata (Kandyan) dance originates from the hill country and is characterized by powerful movements and vibrant "
+"costumes. Pahatharata (Low-country) dance is known for its ritualistic significance, with dancers performing to invoke blessings "
+"and ward off evil spirits. Sabaragamuwa dance, from the central province, blends both Kandyan and Low-country elements, often "

+"the deep connection between sound, ritual, and tradition.";

export const p12 = "Sri Lankan traditional literature is deeply intertwined with Buddhism, with much of the country’s ancient writings "
+"being composed by Buddhist monks (Theros). The most significant body of work is the Pali Canon or the Tripitaka, which contains the "
+"teachings of the Buddha. These texts were originally passed down orally before being written on palm leaves in monasteries such as "
+"the Aluvihare temple. Aside from religious texts, ancient Sri Lankan literature includes historical chronicles like the Mahavamsa, "

+"religious and cultural heritage of Sri Lanka." ;

export const p13= "Sri Lanka’s traditional arts are a reflection of its cultural diversity, shaped by centuries of religious and social "
+"influences. These art forms include intricate wood carving, metalwork, pottery, and traditional painting. Temple paintings, especially "

+"often use natural dyes and are painted in vivid detail. Another significant art form is the creation of devil masks, used in ritualistic "
+"dances to ward off evil spirits. The craftsmanship in these masks is a hallmark of Sri Lanka’s artistic heritage. The island is also "
+"renowned for its traditional weaving, with handloom textiles that feature unique patterns and bright colors, reflecting the local culture.";

export const p14= "Sri Lanka boasts a rich tradition of stone art, particularly evident in the majestic statues that adorn ancient temples and "
+"historical sites. The island is home to some of the finest examples of stone carvings, including the famous Buddha statues of Anuradhapura and "

export const p15= "Sri Lanka’s wooden carving tradition is an ancient art form that has been passed down through generations. These carvings, "
+"known for their intricate detailing and symbolic meaning, can be found in temples, palaces, and homes across the island. Traditional wooden "
+"carvings often feature religious figures, floral patterns, and mythical creatures, showcasing the deep spiritual and cultural significance "
+"embedded in Sri Lankan art. Temples like the Embekke Devalaya are famous for their wooden pillars adorned with complex carvings of animals, "
+"dancers, and deities. Skilled craftsmen typically use native woods such as teak, sandalwood, and ebony, carefully shaping and chiseling the "

export const p17 = "Sri Lanka's history is a tale of ancient kingdoms, colonial rule, and post-independence politics. The island was "
+"ruled by a series of powerful kings who established great cities such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. King Dutugemunu, known for his "
+"unification of the island, is a celebrated figure in Sri Lankan history. The island’s strategic position attracted foreign powers, "
+"leading to invasions from South Indian Chola dynasties and later European colonizers—Portuguese, Dutch, and British. Each colonial power "
+"left its mark on Sri Lanka’s culture and infrastructure. Following a long struggle, Sri Lanka gained independence from British rule in "
+"1948. Post-independence politics have been dominated by issues of ethnic tensions between the Sinhalese majority and Tamil minority, "
+"culminating in a brutal civil war that lasted from 1983 to 2009. The defeat of the Tamil Tigers ended the war, but reconciliation and "

+"moving forward.";

export const p20 = "Sri Lanka's modern political history is marked by significant milestones and challenges since gaining independence "
+"from British colonial rule in 1948. Initially, the political landscape was dominated by the United National Party (UNP) under the "
+"leadership of D. S. Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of independent Sri Lanka. His administration focused on agricultural development "
+"and economic reforms, while promoting a non-aligned foreign policy.\n\n"
+"In 1956, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party "
+"(SLFP), came to power, ushering in a wave of nationalist policies that prioritized the Sinhala language and Buddhist culture. This "
+"shift heightened ethnic tensions with the Tamil minority, leading to decades of political unrest. Bandaranaike's assassination in "
+"1959 brought his widow, Sirimavo Bandaranaike, to power, making her the world’s first female prime minister. Under her leadership, "
+"the country saw a move toward socialist policies, including nationalization of industries.";
export const p21 = "The political landscape became increasingly polarized over time, with the rise of Tamil nationalism in response to "
+"perceived marginalization. This led to the formation of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), which sought a separate Tamil "
+"state in the north and east. The ensuing civil war between the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE lasted from 1983 to 2009, claiming "
+"thousands of lives and causing significant displacement. It was not until 2009, under President Mahinda Rajapaksa, that the war ended "
+"with the military defeat of the LTTE.\n\n"
+"Post-war politics have focused on reconciliation and development, though ethnic tensions persist. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s leadership was "
+"marked by major infrastructure projects but also accusations of authoritarianism and corruption. In 2015, he was defeated by "
+"Maithripala Sirisena in an election that promised democratic reforms and a focus on national unity. However, political instability "
+"continued, with frequent changes in leadership and government coalitions.\n\n"
+"In 2019, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Mahinda’s brother, was elected president, bringing the Rajapaksa family back to power. His tenure saw "
+"economic challenges, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and financial mismanagement. In 2022, public unrest due to severe economic "
+"hardships led to widespread protests, eventually resulting in Gotabaya’s resignation. Sri Lanka's modern political journey continues "
